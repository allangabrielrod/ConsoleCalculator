# Console Calculator

The goal of this project is to have a working application. It helps you to see if you understand and are able to apply the basic building blocks of the C# programming language to build a working console application.



### The following features should be implemented:

- Ask the user for two numbers and a calculation method.
- Valid calculation methods are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- After the user has input their information, calculate the result and print it on the console.
- After the result has been printed, ask the user for another calculation. The program should only end if the user decides that he does not want to calculate another result.

### Optional Features:

- Implement additional operations such as modulo or something else you want to implement.
